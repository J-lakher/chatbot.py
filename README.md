This project, titled "Web-based Chatbot for College Enquiry," was created by Pramila Kafle and Jagriti Lakher. It is intended to be a partial fulfillment of the requirements for a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and Information Technology.
This repository contains the source code for a web-based chatbot designed to answer college enquiry questions. The chatbot can be used by prospective students to learn more about the college, its programs, admissions process, and other relevant information.The goal of this project is to create a web-based chatbot that can respond promptly and  accurately to frequent queries and concerns about college applications, academics, and student  life. The chatbot is designed to be user-friendly and available to a variety of users, including  parents, staff members, current students, and prospective students. The chatbot's  comprehension and responsiveness to user inquiries is improved through the application of  Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods. 
To ensure a smooth user experience, the project also integrates the chatbot with the existing  college websites and systems. Overall, the web-based chatbot has the potential to increase the  effectiveness and efficiency of the college's inquiry services and raise stakeholder and student  satisfaction levels. 
The chatbot also comes with a knowledge base that contains information on campus amenities,  admissions requirements, educational programs, and other relevant topics. As a result, the  chatbot can respond to users' inquiries in a tailored and contextualized manner.
